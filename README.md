# Introduction To Python and Data Science
_LSE &mdash; Department of Statistics &mdash; Spring Term 2019_

Welcome! This is the page for the *Introduction To Python and Data Science* course. Here you will find the course material, as well as instructions for setting up Python on your computer.

## The First Lecture

### A bit of admin
- **Attendance Register:** Please sign your name on the sheet at the front of the class.
- **Post-its:** As you come into the class, you will find green and orange post-it notes next to the register sheet; please take one of each. You will use these during the class exercises to tell me how you are doing:
  - A *green* post-it stuck to your laptop means you have completed the exercise and are happy for the class to continue.
  - An *orange* post-it stuck to your laptop means you have a question and want me to take a look at your code.
  - No post-it means you are still working on it.

### Setting up Python and Jupyter Notebooks
We will be using the latest stable version of Python 3 for the course --- this is Python 3.7 at the time of writing. Follow these steps to set up everything you will need in a couple of minutes:
1. Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Make sure to choose the 3.7 version!
2. Execute the installer and follow the default steps. This might take a little longer.
3. In the meantime, download the first notebook from this page. Notebooks have the file extension `.ipynb`.
4. Once the Anaconda installation finishes, find the **Jupyter Notebook** app. Alternatively, you can run `jupyter notebook`on your system's command line. The notebook browser should open automatically.
5. Navigate the browser to the notebook you just downloaded and open it. You're ready to go!

## Lecture Worksheets
We will use Jupyter Notebooks for the majority of the course. Each worksheet will be released on this page shortly before the start of the lecture. You should download the worksheet and follow along &mdash; the only way to learn programming is by doing! Nonetheless, a completed worksheet will also be released after the lecture.

## Questions?
> Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.

Ask me! You can ask me during lectures, during excercises, or at the end of each class. You can also email me at [r.bailo@imperial.ac.uk](mailto:r.bailo@imperial.ac.uk) if you have questions during the week. I will try to answer short questions promptly; if the question is longer or particularly interesting we might discuss it in class instead.
